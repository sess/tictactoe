# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Overview: 
In this unit, coders will create the classic game of tic tac toe in their brower! The user will input moves as player X or O on a tic tac toe board. When a player wins, the game will end and a message will display the winner.

## Day 1

#### Planning
- [x] Complete the project planning document.
#### Set-Up
- [x] Go to the repository at https://github.com/khdou/tictactoe
- [x] Fork this repository to your github account and clone to a new workspace
- [x] Add, commit, and push your changes
- [x] Make your site live on gh-pages

### JavaScript
- [x] Create a variable that keeps track of the current player (either a string of "X" or "O")
- [x] Implement behavior to place pieces on the board. Do this by filling in the performLogic(buttonId, tileId) function to remove the button of the corresponding buttonId, and to change the text of the div that is the tileId to the player variable.
- [x] Call the performLogic function in every button click handler.

#### Wrap
- [x] Push your changes!
- [x] Save and submit your website using the link on the Daily Session Document.

## Day 2

### Javascript 

- [x] Implement behavior that will change the turns of the player. Do this by writing a function that will change the current player to either "X" or "O" depending on the current player. Decide where to put this function. 
- [x] Create a variable that keeps track of the total number of turns taken
- [x] Implement behavior that will make the game Draw after 9 pieces are placed. Do this by writing a function that will add 1 to the current turns, and check if that counter has reached 9. 
- [ ] Create a variable of boolean type that will signal whether or not the game has ended.
- [ ] Implement behavior that will stop the game after a Draw occurs. Do this by changing your piece-placing function to check if the game has ended first before placing a piece.

#### Wrap
- [ ] Push your changes!

## Day 3

## JavaScript
- [x] Implement behavior that will end the game when a player wins. First write a function with 3 parameters of the tileIds, and return if the value of the each of the tileIds are equal to the current player
- [x] Next, write a function checkVerticalWins that will call the function above on all of the vertical combinations of tiles
- [x] Next, write a function checkHoritzontalWins that will call the function above on all of the horizontal combinations of tiles
- [x] Next, write a function checkDiagonalWins that will call the function above on all of the diagonal combinations
- [x] In each of the win functions, if the win condition is satisfied, set the end game variable to true, and change the title to "[Player] Wins!"
- [x] Determine the appropriate location to place the Win functions

#### Wrap
- [x] Push your changes!

## Project Extensions:
- [x] Add in your own css to personalize your project
- [ ] Create a button that will reset the game back to the original (this requires clearing the Xs and Os, and putting the "move" buttons back)
- [ ] Keep track of the score bewteen the two players: X wins, O wins, and draws
- [ ] Change the 9 button functions to instead be one generic function on the button selector 
- [ ] Change the board to be 4x4 and end the game when there is a 4 in a row
